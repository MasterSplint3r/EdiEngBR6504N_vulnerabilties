# EdiEngBR6504N_vulnerabilties
Research project to find vulnerabilties in the Edimax EngBR6504N router and implement exploits.
This project is purely for personal research and education purposes.
The router is a fairly ancient (last firmware update from 2009) that i found at home and decided to reverse in order to learn more about embeded security.
